The Universal Composability (UC) framework is widely used in cryptography and
secure protocol design, and has been especially useful in off-chain /
cross-blockchain protocols where layered composition is pushed to its limit.
Recently, the formal verification community has begun to mechanize UC. I’ll
focus on a complementary research direction that aims to show that UC can be a
useful tool for application programmers, not just security analysts.

First, I’ll briefly present on our work ILC (PLDI’19) and ongoing work Nomos-UC
that establishes a process calculus foundation for the ITMs model that UC is
built atop. I’ll also give some examples from our ongoing work on SaUCy, a
programming framework that focuses on bringing benefits of Ideal Functionality
specifications to developers, even before we arrive at full formal
verification. Finally I’ll share some experience and insights from a seminar
course on UC that focuses on the programmer’s viewpoint.
