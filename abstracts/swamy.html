<p>
F* (https://fstar-lang.org) is a general purpose, proof-oriented programming
language built on a foundation of dependent types.

<p>
It’s perhaps unique among dependently typed languages in that its design and
development has been closely tied to applications in cryptography and secure
systems, notably high-performance implementations of cryptographic primitives
in HACL*, Vale, and EverCrypt.

<p>
In this talk, I'll focus on Zeta, a new framework to augment a service with a
concurrent runtime monitor, enabling skeptical clients of the service to detect
when the service violates a given safety property.

<p>
Zeta uses a combination of techniques, including cryptography and trusted
execution environments, to construct a compact, authenticated data structure
summarizing the state of the service.

<p>
We built an implementation of Zeta in F*, proving its correctness and security
using Steel (<a href="https://www.fstar-lang.org/papers/steel/">https://www.fstar-lang.org/papers/steel/</a>), a concurrent separation
logic embedded in F*. The methodology we developed suggests several general
techniques that can be used to verify protocols whose implementations involve
concurrency.
