In this talk we summarize our recent efforts developing efficient
high-assurance implementations of advanced cryptographic protocol such as
secure multi-party computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proof systems.
Such high-assurance implementations are automatically extracted from formally
verified protocols specifications in EasyCrypt. We show how such automatically
extracted implementations do not suffer from a significant performance overhead
(as one may initially expect them to), even though they do not incorporate
natural performance-boosting optimizations such as parallelism.
